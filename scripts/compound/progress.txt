## Codebase Patterns
- Trending query located in web/src/lib/queries/tools.ts (getTrendingTools function)
- Database schema uses Prisma ORM defined in web/prisma/schema.prisma
- GitHub stars stored in `stars` field (not github_stars) in Tool model
- API endpoints follow pattern: web/src/app/api/v1/{resource}/{action}/route.ts
- Current fallback uses compositeScore instead of stars (PRD requires stars)

## 2026-02-01 00:10 - T-001
- Located trending tools query in codebase
- Files identified:
  - web/src/lib/queries/tools.ts - contains getTrendingTools() function (lines 78-104)
  - web/src/app/api/v1/tools/trending/route.ts - API endpoint that exposes trending tools
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Existing code already has fallback mechanism (lines 90-101 in tools.ts)
  - Current fallback uses `compositeScore DESC` ordering
  - PRD requirement is to use `stars DESC` (GitHub stars) instead
  - Database field is named `stars` not `github_stars` in schema
  - Query uses Prisma ORM with prisma.tool.findMany()
