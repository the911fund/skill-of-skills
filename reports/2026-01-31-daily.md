# Daily Report - 2026-01-31

## Project Status

Skill of Skills is an autonomous discovery engine for Claude Code tools. Phases 1-2 complete, Phases 3-5 pending.

## Key Metrics

- Tools indexed: 71
- Categories: 11
- Total stars tracked: 780k+
- Web directory: https://skills.911fund.io

## Current Issues

### High Priority

1. **Trust Scoring Not Implemented (Phase 3)**
   - No trust_score field in database
   - Tools ranked only by GitHub stars, not health/trust indicators
   - Users can't distinguish actively maintained tools from abandoned ones
   - Impact: Users may install unmaintained or low-quality tools

2. **Trending Query Returns Empty**
   - When no tools have trendingScore > 0, homepage shows no featured tools
   - Fallback logic missing
   - Impact: Poor user experience on homepage

### Medium Priority

3. **No Trust Indicators in Web UI (Phase 4)**
   - Tool cards don't show maintenance status
   - No visual indicator for commit frequency or contributor health
   - Users must click through to GitHub to assess tool quality

4. **n8n Push to GitHub Still Using Workaround**
   - Phase 1 partial completion due to n8n bug (Buffer.from() not available)
   - README generation requires external script instead of native n8n workflow

### Low Priority

5. **Missing contributor diversity scoring**
   - Single-maintainer tools have same trust as team-maintained tools
   - No fork-to-star ratio analysis

## Recommendations

1. **Fix trending query fallback** - Quick win, improves homepage immediately
2. **Implement trust_score calculation** - Core Phase 3 work, enables better tool ranking
3. **Add trust indicators to UI** - Visual improvement after scoring is ready

## User Feedback

- "How do I know which tools are still maintained?"
- "Some listed tools haven't been updated in months"
- "Would be nice to see activity indicators"

## Technical Debt

- compound.config.json quality checks reference `web/` but should verify paths exist
- No automated tests for trust scoring logic (will need when implementing)
