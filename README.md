## 🔍 How It Works

### Discovery
Repos are automatically discovered by scanning GitHub for Claude Code related projects (skills, plugins, MCP servers). We search for specific file patterns like `SKILL.md`, `mcp.json`, and keywords in repo descriptions.

### Validation *(pending)*
Each tool will be validated in a sandbox environment. We'll check for proper structure, run security scans, and audit dependencies before listing.

### Trending Score
Scores are recalculated every 6 hours based on:
- **GitHub Stars (50%)** — Stars relative to ecosystem (capped at 10k)
- **Recency (50%)** — Exponential decay based on last commit (90-day half-life)

Multipliers applied for risk level and verification status.
