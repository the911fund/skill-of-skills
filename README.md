## 🔍 How It Works

### Discovery
Repos are automatically discovered by scanning GitHub for Claude Code related projects (skills, plugins, MCP servers). We search for specific file patterns like `SKILL.md`, `mcp.json`, and keywords in descriptions.

### Validation *(pending)*
Each tool will be validated in a sandbox environment. We'll check for proper structure, run security scans, and audit dependencies before listing.

### Trending Score
Scores are recalculated every 6 hours based on:
- **GitHub Activity (25%)** — Stars relative to ecosystem
- **Social Mentions (35%)** — X/Twitter and Reddit discussions
- **Recency (25%)** — Recent commits decay over 90 days
- **Influencer Endorsements (15%)** — Mentions by trusted sources
